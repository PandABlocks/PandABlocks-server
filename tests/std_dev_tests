# Some test vectors for std dev calculation

# The format for each vector is four numbers as read by test_std_dev.c:
#
#   n : u32     b : u64     ah : u32    al : u64
#
# where n is the number of samples, b is the sum of values, ah is the top 32
# bits of the sum of squares and al is the bottom 64 bits.

# Now some tests with n=2^32-1

# This one should be a perfect 0

# Here's a properly engineered edge case.  Take x=2^31 for all but one of
# N=2^32-1 samples, take the remaining sample equal to 2^31-1.  Then we can
# compute that N S^2 = 1-1/N and that S = sqrt(N-1)/N ~~ 1.526e-5.
